6sXUYgd22Vg,Oil painting portrait üé® (after Bouguereau) #shorts,"Study after Bouguereau‚Äôs Portrait of Gabrielle Cot. At this point I was using a more simplified version of the Warm-Cool Palette as a starting point for the skin tones (Free Mixing Guide: https://www.annawakitsch.com/links ) plus strings of alizarin crimson & yellow ochre to modify the hue as needed (and occasionally ultramarine blue).

GRExJhr1leE,Paint a tiny watercolour delphinium with me!,"A major tip for painting this tiny flower is using only a LITTLE bit of water and paint (and a small brush too)! When painting smaller, you want to make sure you don‚Äôt over saturate your brush with paint and water. You need much less than you think! Especially when adding the stem and slightly touching the flowers. If you have too much green paint and water on your brush, the colour will over power the flowers and flow right into them. A minimal amount of paint and water will do the trick for those perfect little colour bleeds! Water control is one of the trickiest parts of using watercolour for everyone. With lots of practice, you‚Äôll be a pro in no time! So give it a try and let me know how it goes in the comments! For more in-depth tutorials and more tips, be sure to subscribe to my YouTube channel! Happy painting!

Hi, I am the son of two artists and began painting in my hometown of Richmond, Virginia before I  could walk. I was a rare combination of artist and athlete so I moved to Los Angeles in 2008 to play football for USC. I left the team my  sophomore year to focus on painting and filmmaking, applying the same focus and discipline from my football career to my art. I primarily work in oils, and spend most free days painting ""en plein air"" in my new home of Sarasota Florida.

Zv_OkJfgheM,Top 5 Oil PAINTING Techniques Every Beginner Should Know,"In this video, I will demonstrate the top 5 oil painting techniques that every beginner should know. Whether you're a complete beginner or just looking to improve your painting skills, these techniques will help you create beautiful, expressive paintings with depth, texture, and luminosity.

First, you will see how to use the underpainting technique to establish the composition and value structure of your painting. You'll learn how to plan and simplify your painting process and avoid common mistakes.

Next, I'll demonstrate the glazing technique, which involves painting thin, translucent layers of color on top of each other to create a rich, luminous effect. You'll learn how to create richness in your paintings with this technique.

Then, I'll show you how to use the alla prima technique to paint wet-on-wet in one sitting. You can use this technique to paint quickly and expressively, and improve your brushwork and color mixing skills.

After that, see the the impasto technique, which involves painting with thick, heavily textured paint to create a three-dimensional effect on the canvas. You'll learn how to add texture and depth to your paintings with thick, juicy color notes.

Finally, see how to use the scumbling technique to create loose and expressive paintings with a lot of movement and texture. You'll learn how to apply thin layers of opaque paint  to create a sparkling or broken color effect.

By the end of this video, you'll have a good understanding of the top 5 oil painting techniques that every beginner should know. Try to apply these techniques to your own paintings and create beautiful, expressive works of art. So, grab your paints and brushes, and let's get started!

I am an artist residing in sunny, warm [humid] florida! My paintings are heavily inspired by nature and its beauty. I work primarily in oil paint, and sometimes watercolor. I prefer to work in a mostly realistic style and occasionally experiment outside of that. I post oil painting time lapses, painting lessons and tutorials, drawings, art tips, and occasionally artist vlogs where I share bits of my life as an artist. Creating art is my greatest passion and I'm thankful for the chance to share it with you. ‚ô•

üåêWebsite : 
https://www.florentfarges.com

I am an artist living and working in France. I paint mainly imaginative realism. I‚Äôm mostly self-taught, I learned the techniques of the Academy of the Nineteenth century by myself and now I try to share some of my knowledge with the rest of the world, because I think that beauty still has an important role to play in artistic creation. On YouTube, I do mostly drawing and oil painting techniques videos in the Atelier tradition, I share thoughts and explanations that can be useful to anyone, from beginners to more advanced artists interested in picking up realism and classical figuration.

Hi, I am the son of two artists and began painting in my hometown of Richmond, Virginia before I  could walk. I was a rare combination of artist and athlete so I moved to Los Angeles in 2008 to play football for USC. I left the team my  sophomore year to focus on painting and filmmaking, applying the same focus and discipline from my football career to my art. I primarily work in oils, and spend most free days painting ""en plein air"" in my new home of Sarasota Florida.

np_i6v7Tfsc,Color study for oil painting üé® (Mixing Guide in description) #shorts,"Color study after Ingres portrait of Princesse de Broglie. I used pre-mixed grays plus an ‚Äúopen palette‚Äù (not pre-mixed) of Burnt Umber, Alizarin Crimson, Transparent Red Oxide, & Yellow Ochre (plus Pthalo & Ultramarine for the blue costume). Then I mixed specific ‚Äústrings‚Äù of color progressions with the brush as I painted. However, my teaching palette has evolved as I‚Äôve found it more effective for many students to start instead with just the Warm/Cool Palette as the basis for skin tones. This is extremely simple (just mixtures of Transparent Red Oxide plus black & white) but very controlled and organized. There‚Äôs a free mixing guide on my website https://www.annawakitsch.com/links . Then from this base palette, the hue may be modified if desired with Alizarin & Yellow Ochre.

IFqyxGImTyM,Portrait Painting Tutorial | PAINT like SCULPTURE - Real Time,"Let's think in 3 dimensions today. With this portrait painting we will be pretending that we are sculpting a large block of clay. We will establish the placement of the head with charcoal, and then jump right into paint. Each shape of color will represent a specific angle with respect to the light source. Working from general to specific, our focus is NEVER about COPYING the model. Rather, we INTERPRET visual information and create a painting.

wbGrvTIOoqU,Powerful Watercolor Technique (Most Tutorials Ignore) üíô Blue Orchids,"#watercolortutorial #annabucciarelli #watercolorflower

This video is dedicated to showcasing ""wet-on-damp"" - that elusive technique that can take place between wet on wet and wet on dry, and produces gorgeous soft and natural looking effects. Enjoy!

Hi, I am the son of two artists and began painting in my hometown of Richmond, Virginia before I  could walk. I was a rare combination of artist and athlete so I moved to Los Angeles in 2008 to play football for USC. I left the team my  sophomore year to focus on painting and filmmaking, applying the same focus and discipline from my football career to my art. I primarily work in oils, and spend most free days painting ""en plein air"" in my new home of Sarasota Florida.

Hi, I am the son of two artists and began painting in my hometown of Richmond, Virginia before I  could walk. I was a rare combination of artist and athlete so I moved to Los Angeles in 2008 to play football for USC. I left the team my  sophomore year to focus on painting and filmmaking, applying the same focus and discipline from my football career to my art. I primarily work in oils, and spend most free days painting ""en plein air"" in my new home of Sarasota Florida.

Morning class, I‚Äôm Will Kemp from Will Kemp art school and this week we‚Äôre taking inspiration from around your home.


In this beginner acrylic tutorial, I go through the steps of how I think through my colour composition from choosing the coloured ground to introducing the pigments to slowly building up the piece. 

I really liked this little collection of terracotta pots, they were part of a cottage garden potting shed I‚Äôd visited recently and I loved how it had the strong orange of the terracotta next to the muted oranges of the red brick which was then broken up by the cool greens on the leaves.

On the website, I‚Äôve got an article that talks through the thought process of how I approach this piece and a reference image you can work along from but for now let‚Äôs grab a brew and any remaining biscuits you‚Äôve got left and let‚Äôs get painting.


You might have always wanted to capture the corner of your sunlit living room or an interesting collection of books stacked up on your coffee table or a section of your garden or patio with all the vibrant greens and spring colours 

But when faced with a new painting subject, where do you begin?

How do you decide on the pigments to use or what‚Äôs important to focus on? 

The tendency can be to just get started and ‚Äòwork it out‚Äô as you go along.

But without adopting a systematic approach to your painting, you can be faced with frustration with your colour mixing, wasted time on your drawing and an unsatisfying end result, I want to show you an easier way.

Artist's Story: I‚Äôm Ashley Krieger, a traveling artist that loves to capture all the beauty that I see while I go to new and exciting places. I love to relax and escape in my paintings. So, they are quiet, still, and without commotion, or chaos. I use art to deal with illness, depression, and anxiety. I've noticed so many benefits coping with those when creating art. With God's direction, I realized that one of my purposes in this life is to share the joy I find in art with others. At first, I didn‚Äôt feel worthy, but I started anyway and began selling and teaching art. I love painting and teaching equally, but I am not one without the other. Now I help others all over the world find joy from art. Here I can teach you how to paint - the skills you need, offer you inspiration, and encourage you to be creative.

Qos-7_1hVmQ,How to paint a 4k highly detailed magical forest - Procreate Tutorial,"Hey there :), I am so excited to finally upload this video, it took me 2 full days to actually film, edit and narrate this tutorial and I really hope this is helpful/ interesting/ relaxing to anyone out there. 
I know it is a long one so I added my favorite relaxing music in the background: Morning Hope by Dimitri Diomores and Metaverse by EnjoyMusic.  

I try my best to explain my thinking behind what I am doing, pitfalls and mistakes I have learnt from or still do and what I am currently learning - as well as a mention everytime I switch brushes, which brush I use and why. 

I work on Procreate on my Ipad and use 95% original brushes and textures, the other 5% are modified slightly to suit my needs.

Let me know what you think, and don‚Äôt forget to share if you know anyone who would enjoy this! Thank you for your support, have a magical day!! :))

VjCGJb5ltZM,Acrylic Painting Tutorial - Ocean Sunset (Beginner to Intermediate),"In this acrylic painting tutorial, I wanted to show how to paint a simple and cute ocean sunset scene. This tutorial focuses heavily on blending with acrylics, which can be a tricky thing. We take it step by step to be able to blend a clean pretty sunset sky that is reflected in the water below.

Times have been tough recently, and staying inside to paint is one of the best things that you can do to keep your brain healthy while social distancing or in ""shelter in place"" or in quarantine. So here is a little tutorial for you to do a some painting in these strange times. Learning how to paint is a great way to spend your time while you are inside. Try and relax and destress with this calm little tutorial.

In this painting I used only 4 colors, cyan blue, quinacridone red, medium yellow azo, and titanium white. If you don't have these exact colors, feel free to use any red, blue, yellow, and white.
